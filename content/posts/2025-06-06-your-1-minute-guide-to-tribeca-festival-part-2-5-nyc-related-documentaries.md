Welcome to Part Two of the 1-Minute Guide to Tribeca. Last time, we highlighted narrative films with NYC ties — now we’re turning to documentaries.

The Tribeca Festival has grown into a major platform for all kinds of storytelling, but at its heart, it still champions New York voices and perspectives. This quick list pulls out five docs that do just that — whether through untold local histories, hyper-specific subcultures, or personal stories grounded in the city.

No frills, just real stories and real people. Let’s get to it.

That’s it for Part Two. These five docs are just a small slice of what **Tribeca Festival** has to offer, but each one taps into something real about life in New York - the grit, the nuance, the neighborhoods, the people.

If one catches your eye, don’t wait too long - screenings can fill up fast, especially for buzzier titles. If you're curious about more offbeat events, talks, or experiences, stay tuned - Part Three is coming soon!

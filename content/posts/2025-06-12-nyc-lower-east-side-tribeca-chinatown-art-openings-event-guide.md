This week in downtown Manhattan, a packed lineup of events stretches across the Lower East Side, East Village, SoHo, Tribeca, and Two Bridges. From intimate gallery openings to a lively book launch party and a local wine store’s anniversary celebration, there’s something happening on nearly every block. The art scene offers a wide range of work—from large-scale contemporary installations to tightly curated solo shows, experimental mixed media, and painting rooted in both personal and historical narratives. Meanwhile, the Tribeca Festival continues through Saturday (check out our guides [Part 1](https://14thbelow.com/posts/2025-06-06-your-1-minute-guide-to-tribeca-festival-part-1-10-nyc-related-narrative-feature-films/),[ Part 2](https://14thbelow.com/posts/2025-06-06-your-1-minute-guide-to-tribeca-festival-part-2-5-nyc-related-documentaries/), [Part 3](https://14thbelow.com/posts/2025-06-06-your-1-minute-guide-to-tribeca-festival-part-3-11-high-profile-feature-films/)), bringing premieres, panels, and pop-up events to venues throughout the neighborhood.

As the week winds down, make sure to carve out time for a visit to Perrotin New York, where this week’s featured artist, Josh Sperling, is showing new work. Born in Oneonta and based in Ithaca, Sperling bridges the gap between painting and sculpture with his vibrant, shaped canvases and architecturally inspired constructions. His pieces—built from intricately cut plywood and stretched canvas, then saturated in bold, clashing color—playfully challenge the boundaries of form, function, and fine art. Drawing from both minimalist painting traditions and contemporary design, Sperling’s work pulses with rhythm, movement, and a sense of visual invention that feels right at home in the heart of the city. Whether you're deep in the festival circuit or just wandering between openings, his show is a must-see in this week’s downtown mix.

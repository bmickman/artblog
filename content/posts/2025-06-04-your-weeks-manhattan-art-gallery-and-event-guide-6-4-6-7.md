Whether you’re making the rounds in the Lower East Side or wandering into a West Village brownstone gallery, this week’s art openings across Lower Manhattan highlight just how varied and vital the downtown scene continues to be. From Chinatown’s emerging project spaces to Tribeca’s polished white cubes, the exhibitions on view speak to both a reverence for tradition and a hunger for reinvention.

A standout this week is Chad Murray’s solo exhibition John of Patmos at Sebastian Gladstone Gallery, an ambitious series of oil paintings that revisits the apocalyptic imagery of The Book of Revelation. But Murray isn’t interested in spectacle — instead, his work questions the very stability of historical painting, exploring how familiar images are repurposed, reinterpreted, and ultimately reshaped through time. His fragmented landscapes and obscured forms invite viewers to see history not as fixed narrative, but as an evolving lens — one that continues to reflect our current moment as much as any ancient text.

Don’t forget to check out our interactive map of Friday’s openings, which includes detailed info on participating galleries across Tribeca, the Lower East Side, Chinatown, Two Bridges, and the West Village. And later this week, we’ll be sharing our full Tribeca Festival preview, spotlighting a mix of visual art, film, and performance across the neighborhood.

Until then, explore widely — the art of downtown Manhattan never stays still for long.

As you plan your NYC Lower Manhattan gallery crawl this week, don’t miss our featured solo exhibition at CHART, now on view in the gallery’s lower-level PROJECTION space. Ian Myers: The cut worm forgives the plow anchors this week’s Tribeca and Lower East Side art openings with a focused presentation of ten 10×8-inch egg tempera paintings on marble dust ground—offering a materially rich counterpoint to the neighborhood’s fast-moving contemporary exhibition calendar.

Taking its title from a line in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell by William Blake, the exhibition reflects a conceptual framework rooted in ambiguity, devotion, and contradiction—qualities that closely parallel Myers’s painting process. By working in egg tempera, a historically significant medium associated with early religious icon painting, Myers situates his practice within a lineage that emphasizes surface, time, and material limitation—key concerns in current contemporary painting discourse across Tribeca and the Lower East Side gallery scene.

Optimized for close looking, the exhibition’s reduced scale intensifies the relationship between gesture and ground, allowing layered surfaces to develop gradually and reward sustained viewing—an experience that resonates with collectors, curators, and audiences seeking out emerging artists during this week’s NYC gallery openings. A monochrome green panel titled field highlights the tension between illusion and objecthood, foregrounding the physicality of paint within an increasingly digital exhibition landscape.

Continuing CHART’s PROJECTION series dedicated to emerging and underrecognized artists, Ian Myers: The cut worm forgives the plow stands out as a must-see stop among this week’s Lower Manhattan art openings in Tribeca and LES—offering a timely addition to February 2026’s downtown New York contemporary art exhibitions.

August in New York brings a slower pace to the art scene, with fewer but more deliberate exhibitions and receptions. This month’s listings focus on art-related events across the Lower East Side, Tribeca, and the West Village—three neighborhoods where galleries remain active even in the summer lull. From intimate artist receptions to thought-provoking solo shows, these events offer a chance to explore contemporary work without the usual crowds.

[Superrare](https://superrare.com/), 243 Bowery, 'First Impressions' by mendezmendez, 7pm-9pm

Our featured artist, Beom Jun, is showing Infinite Layers, Unfixed Mountains, a body of work rooted in existential inquiry and shaped by a meditative process of painting and erasure. Drawing on the layered mountain ranges he encountered traveling between Seoul and his hometown of Jeonju, Jun builds compositions from transparent washes, allowing forms to emerge slowly through repeated gestures. The result is a series of works where mountains become metaphors for time, history, and the fluid boundaries between past, present, and future. In the Lower East Side, Tribeca, and West Village this August, his paintings offer a quiet but resonant counterpoint to the city’s summer heat—a reminder that presence can emerge through patience.

Whether you’re gallery-hopping in the Lower East Side, wandering through the industrial-chic spaces of Tribeca, or catching a late-summer opening in the West Village, August offers a slower, more intentional way to experience New York’s art scene. These events are fewer in number but rich in detail, giving you time to pause, look closely, and connect with the work on view. From Beom Jun’s meditative mountain landscapes to other standout exhibitions across these neighborhoods, this month is an invitation to explore the city’s creative pulse at a pace that lets each piece linger in your mind long after you’ve left the gallery.

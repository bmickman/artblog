The first art crawl of 2026 kicks off the new year with gallery openings across New York City’s downtown art neighborhoods, including the Lower East Side, NoHo, the West Village, and Tribeca. As NYC galleries return from the holiday pause, this week marks a renewed moment for contemporary art, emerging artists, and community-driven exhibitions. Gallery hopping through these iconic New York art districts is a time-honored way to reconnect with the city’s creative pulse and set the tone for the year ahead. Start 2026 immersed in NYC’s art scene, exploring galleries, exhibitions, and cultural spaces that continue to define New York City as a global center for contemporary art.

This week’s featured artist spotlight turns to Jane Haimes, whose solo exhibition Odd Poetry at Trotter & Sholer offers a compelling moment within New York City’s contemporary art landscape. Known for her distinctive abstract paintings on wooden panels, Haimes creates works driven by color, form, and an exacting studio process. Her compositions function as non-narrative “tone poems,” inviting viewers to experience abstraction beyond representation and language.

Working through extended periods of experimentation, Haimes builds each painting through layers of hand-mixed color, glazes, and meticulous surface refinement. Shape and color stretch and press against the two-dimensional plane, resulting in self-contained abstract objects that reward slow looking. In an era defined by digital saturation and rapid consumption, Haimes’ process-centered approach feels both deliberate and necessary within today’s NYC art scene.

As galleries across the Lower East Side and downtown Manhattan reopen for the first art crawl of 2026, Odd Poetry stands out as a reminder of the power of abstraction, materiality, and sustained attention. For those exploring NYC gallery openings, contemporary abstract painting, and emerging and mid-career artists in New York, Jane Haimes’ work offers a quietly resonant way to close the week—and begin the year—with art.

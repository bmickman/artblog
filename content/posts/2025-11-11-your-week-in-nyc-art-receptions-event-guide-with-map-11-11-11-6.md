Downtown Manhattan comes alive this week across the Lower East Side, Tribeca, SoHo, the East Village, and Greenwich Village, with galleries presenting a mix of emerging and established artists. Among the standout exhibitions is Xanthe Burdett’s Psychopomp at Palo Gallery, a captivating series of paintings and panel works where human and plant forms intertwine in ethereal, myth-inspired compositions. Burdett’s layered technique, combining chalk transfers, white gesso, and translucent green washes, creates luminous, otherworldly worlds that explore encounters with the unknown and the intersections of life and afterlife.

From Ludlow Street’s intimate galleries to Tribeca’s conceptual spaces and SoHo’s pop-inspired exhibitions, downtown New York offers a dynamic landscape for art exploration. Whether you are following emerging voices like Burdett or visiting landmark galleries, this week’s openings highlight the vibrancy of NYC’s contemporary art scene.

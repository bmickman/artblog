Tribeca and Lower Manhattan continue to be a hub for contemporary art, offering visitors a mix of vibrant gallery openings, exhibitions, and cultural events this week. A standout highlight is the debut solo exhibition of Rafael Kamada at Storage Gallery (52 Walker St), on view from Friday, September 26th through Saturday, November 1st, 2025. Born in 1993 and living and working in Brazil, Kamada’s recent oil paintings dwell in the liminal space between figuration and abstraction, exploring memory, landscape, and the passage of time. His layered process of application, removal, and reapplication builds surfaces that carry the weight of history while remaining open to disruption, revealing subtle traces of light, structure, and nature that linger on the edge of perception.

Influenced by both Eastern and Western artistic traditions—including the spatial logic of Japanese printmakers Hokusai and Hiroshige, as well as the atmospheric touch of Monet and Diebenkorn—Kamada’s work combines instinct, intuition, and rigorous study. Each painting rewards careful attention, offering fragments of landscape and memory that unfold gradually, creating an intimate, immersive experience for viewers.

While exploring Tribeca’s galleries or attending Thursday’s Autumn Art Night across the neighborhood and nearby Soho, Kamada’s exhibition provides a reflective, contemplative complement to the area’s energetic art scene. For collectors, enthusiasts, or anyone looking to experience the pulse of Lower Manhattan’s contemporary art, his debut solo show is not to be missed.

*F﻿eatured work above by François Halard at Ruttkowski;68*

To cap off this week’s slate of openings, our featured highlight comes from François Halard, whose exhibition Conversation with Claude at Ruttkowski;68 offers a rare and poetic pause. In 26 hand-painted, enlarged Polaroids, Halard retraces his steps through Claude Monet’s Giverny garden, layering his own vision onto the master’s obsessions with light, water, and reflection. The result is less a documentation than an intimate dialogue—between Halard and Monet, France and Japan, past and present. It’s a reminder, amid the flood of new shows, that the most enduring art often begins as a quiet conversation across time.

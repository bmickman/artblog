The New York City art world kicks off its fall season with major art openings in Tribeca and the Lower East Side (LES), two of the city’s most vibrant gallery districts. This week’s exhibitions spotlight cutting-edge photography, experimental painting, and immersive installations that set the stage for the season ahead. With Tribeca’s rapidly growing concentration of contemporary art galleries and the LES continuing to showcase bold and emerging talent, these neighborhoods are the must-visit destinations for anyone tracking NYC contemporary art shows. Whether you’re a collector, curator, or simply looking for the best art exhibitions in New York this weekend, downtown is where the season begins—with energy, ambition, and plenty to see.

This weekend’s featured artist is Rodrigo Valenzuela, whose solo exhibition Los restos at Asya Geisberg Gallery offers one of the most talked-about new shows in Chelsea and beyond. Valenzuela presents his ongoing New Land series—large-scale canvases inspired by Chile’s Atacama Desert—alongside black-and-white silver gelatin prints that capture abandoned objects and relics as anti-monuments. Together, the works confront histories of violence, displacement, and utopian failure while drawing viewers into a layered meditation on photography, painting, and memory. Installed on a striking wooden scaffold structure, Los restos is a must-see exhibition that positions Valenzuela among the most compelling voices in contemporary art today.

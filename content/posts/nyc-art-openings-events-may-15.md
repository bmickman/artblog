This week’s downtown Manhattan art scene—spanning NoHo, SoHo, Tribeca, and the Lower East Side—features London-based artist Tancredi di Carcaci, whose sculptural works are a must-see. Known for his mastery of stone, bronze, and ceramic, di Carcaci explores the symbolism of idolatry as a metaphor for the conflict between people, power, and belief systems.

Blending figurative sculpture and abstract forms, his work evokes a sense of the numinous while referencing both Renaissance art and the mythology of ancient Greece and Rome. Through the lost wax technique, he crafts sanctified bodies that challenge the viewer to see through both a contemporary and ancient lens. Competing materials and sacred motifs blur the lines between effigy and icon, inviting deep reflection on art’s role in shaping identity and ideology.

If you're exploring art galleries in SoHo, sculpture exhibits in Tribeca, or contemporary art in the Lower East Side, Tancredi di Carcaci’s work is not to be missed. It’s a powerful intersection of history, materiality, and metaphor—on view now in downtown NYC.

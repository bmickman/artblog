As the week comes to a close in Lower Manhattan, the galleries and pop-ups of the Lower East Side, Soho, and Tribeca continue to offer a vibrant snapshot of the city’s contemporary art scene. A standout this week is Emily Rose Wright at Harkawik in Tribeca, whose hauntingly evocative, largely monochromatic works draw viewers in with layered textures, subtle patterning, and a delicate balance of abstraction and figuration. Wright’s pieces reward close observation, offering moments of discovery that resonate long after leaving the gallery. Alongside experimental group shows, immersive installations, and intimate solo exhibitions across these neighborhoods, her work embodies the energy and creativity that make Lower Manhattan a hub for cutting-edge art. Whether you’re a longtime gallery-goer or exploring the city’s art scene for the first time, there’s no shortage of experiences to discover this week.

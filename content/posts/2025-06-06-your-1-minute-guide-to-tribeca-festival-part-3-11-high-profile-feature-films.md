Welcome to Part Three of the 1-Minute Guide to Tribeca. We’ve covered NYC-centered narratives and standout documentaries — now we’re looking at films that come with a little more star power.

This batch features more familiar names on screen — the kind of casts that might draw headlines or longer lines - but they’re still Tribeca selections, which means you can expect a mix of indie spirit, interesting risks, and stories you won’t find in wide release (at least not yet).

Whether you're in it for the performances, the directors, or just curious what some big names are doing outside of the blockbuster circuit - here are a few to keep on your radar. Let’s dive in.

That wraps up Part Three. Just because these films feature familiar faces doesn’t mean they’re playing it safe - in true Tribeca fashion, there’s still plenty of room for surprises, risks, and offbeat stories.

If something caught your attention, don’t wait too long to grab tickets - screenings with bigger names tend to fill up fast. And whether you’ve followed all three parts or just dipped in here and there, hopefully this guide helped cut through the noise and pointed you toward something worth seeing. Happy festival-going!

*F﻿eatured work above by François Halard at Ruttowski;68*

Rounding out this week’s New York art exhibitions is François Halard’s Conversation with Claude at Ruttkowski;68 Gallery. Presenting 26 one-of-a-kind, hand-painted Polaroid photographs inspired by Monet’s iconic gardens in Giverny, the show blends photography, painting, and history in a way that feels both timeless and contemporary. For collectors, curators, and art lovers looking to experience one of the season’s most thoughtful photography exhibitions, Halard’s work offers a rare opportunity to see how modern artists reinterpret the legacies of Impressionism. It’s a must-see for anyone exploring the best gallery shows in New York this week.

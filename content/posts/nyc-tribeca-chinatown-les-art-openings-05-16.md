This weekend’s NYC art openings in Lower East Side, Chinatown, and Tribeca feature the work of Z.T. Nguyễn, whose exhibition explores themes of migration, identity, and transience. Nguyễn’s distinctive drawings and installations, created using materials like folded paper, acrylic, and graphite, reflect on the fragile nature of memory and movement. The works engage with the personal and political dimensions of queer diasporic life, offering a compelling look at the intersections of history, culture, and contemporary experience. Be sure to visit this unique show as part of your downtown NYC art tour.

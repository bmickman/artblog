As you explore this week’s art listings across the Lower East Side, SoHo, NoHo, East Village, West Village, and Tribeca, be sure to reference our Thursday map for an easy route through the most exciting openings happening downtown. Whether you're tracking down large-scale installations in Tribeca or intimate painting shows on the LES, the city's creative energy is in full force.

Our featured artist this week is John Knuth, whose highly anticipated solo exhibition, The Hot Garden, opens Thursday at Hollis Taggart Downtown (109 Norfolk Street). This marks Knuth’s fourth solo outing with the gallery—and his most personal yet. Following the devastating Eaton Fire earlier this year, which destroyed his Los Angeles home and studio archive, Knuth returns with a stunning mix of resilience and radical process. The exhibition includes his signature “fly paintings” and a live sculptural installation in which flies will actively create artwork in the gallery during the opening week. Incorporating fragments salvaged from the fire, The Hot Garden reimagines destruction as creation—an alchemical transformation in true Knuth fashion.

So whether you're venturing out to see innovative textile works or attending a buzzworthy magazine launch, this mid-week collection is proof that downtown Manhattan remains a beating heart of artistic reinvention.

As this week’s featured artist, Pamela Hanson takes center stage in Soho’s gallery scene with her exhibition In the ’90s at Staley Wise, 100 Crosby Street. Hanson is celebrated for her intimate and personal approach to photographing models, capturing candid moments of friendship, fun, and real connection—offering a refreshing contrast to the posed fashion images typical of magazines. Her early career in Paris in the 1980s shaped her ability to understand her subjects deeply, a perspective that helped her become one of the pioneering women in fashion photography.

Coinciding with the close of New York Fashion Week 2025, this exhibition is a must-see for visitors exploring Soho, the Lower East Side, the East Village, and Chinatown, blending the energy of NYC’s fashion and art scenes. Paired with the release of her book The ’90s (Rizzoli), featuring previously unpublished images, Hanson’s work is a love letter to a transformative decade in style and culture. For anyone planning an NYC gallery crawl, this show exemplifies the vibrant creativity thriving across the city’s iconic neighborhoods.

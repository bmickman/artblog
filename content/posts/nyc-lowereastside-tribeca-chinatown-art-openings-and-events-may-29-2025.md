As this weekend's vibrant array of Lower Manhattan art openings comes to a close, be sure not to miss the standout exhibition: Yooyun Yang’s "Uncommon Sight" at Stephen Friedman Gallery, marking her first solo show in New York . Yang, a Seoul-based artist born in 1985, is renowned for her atmospheric paintings that delve into themes of solitude and emotional introspection. Working with diluted acrylics on traditional Korean Jangji paper, she crafts shadowy, cinematic scenes that blur the lines between reality and imagination. Her latest works explore the concept of 'visual error,' where everyday objects—like blinds, curtains, and railings—transform into uncanny, anthropomorphic forms, challenging viewers' perceptions.

To navigate Thursday's bustling art scene, utilize our interactive gallery map, guiding you through the myriad of exhibitions across the Lower East Side, Two Bridges, Chinatown, SoHo, and the West Village. Additionally, don't miss the Greenpoint Open Studios event running throughout the weekend, offering a unique opportunity to explore the creative spaces of Brooklyn's vibrant artist community. Whether you're a seasoned collector or an art enthusiast, this weekend promises a rich tapestry of contemporary art experiences.

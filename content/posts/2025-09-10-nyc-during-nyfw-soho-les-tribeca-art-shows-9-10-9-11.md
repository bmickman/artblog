This week’s downtown art openings reach a high point with Jean-Luc Moulène’s fifth solo exhibition in New York, a dazzling presentation of 20 new works spanning cardboard, bronze, glass, bone glue, and cement. Oscillating between geometric abstraction and enigmatic figuration, Moulène’s sculptures embody both intellectual rigor and playful invention, offering viewers a glimpse into art’s power to reshape ideas into material form. With a career that includes solo shows at the Centre Pompidou, Dia:Beacon, and SculptureCenter, as well as appearances at Documenta and the Venice Biennale, Moulène stands as one of the most important contemporary sculptors working today. As NYFW infuses Manhattan with style and spectacle, his latest exhibition underscores how the Lower East Side, Tribeca, and SoHo remain at the forefront of cultural innovation — where art and fashion together set the tone for the season.

As the week’s gallery openings and downtown art events unfold across the Lower East Side, Tribeca, East Village, and Two Bridges, make time to experience i still look for her in every lifetime, the debut solo exhibition by New York-based artist Andina Marie Osorio at HESSE FLATOW. Osorio’s work stands out not only for its emotional depth but also for its formal innovation—melding photography, archival materials, and galvanized steel into sculptural installations that explore themes of queer identity, Afro-Caribbean heritage, Black femme desire, migration, and intergenerational memory. Her use of family photographs, worker IDs, and personal ephemera—some dating back to the 1930s—grounds her work in lived experience while opening up larger conversations about visibility, longing, and self-representation within the context of queer and diasporic life.

Drawing visual influence from Caribbean architectural forms and shaped by her experiences in communities like Brooklyn and Fire Island, Osorio’s practice offers an embodied, reflective approach to image-making—one that invites viewers to reconsider what archives can reveal and withhold. Her debut comes at a time when downtown Manhattan's art scene is reasserting its importance as a hub for experimental, intimate, and politically engaged work. Whether you're following our LES Friday night map, exploring new gallery spaces in Tribeca or Two Bridges, or celebrating local creativity at a vintage shop’s anniversary, Osorio’s exhibition provides a powerful anchor—offering quiet resonance amid the week’s many openings. Don’t miss the chance to experience one of the most thoughtful and affecting shows currently on view in downtown NYC.

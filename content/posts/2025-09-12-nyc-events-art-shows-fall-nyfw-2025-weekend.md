This weekend, visitors to Tribeca, the Lower East Side, Two Bridges, and Chinatown have a unique opportunity to experience the compelling work of Justine Otto, whose paintings masterfully straddle the line between abstraction and figuration. Otto’s layered canvases allow hints of figures and faces to emerge from ambiguous, often textured backgrounds, creating a sense of mystery and narrative depth. Her subjects range from archetypal generals and solitary cowboys to solo and ensemble musicians, each captured through techniques like wet-on-wet painting, taping, and scraping, allowing them to surface—or dissolve—within the composition. The enigmatic activities and anonymous identities of her figures invite viewers to linger, reflect, and interpret, offering a rich, immersive encounter with contemporary art. Situated within the dynamic gallery scenes of downtown Manhattan, Otto’s work stands out among this weekend’s exhibitions, providing an essential stop for collectors, art enthusiasts, and anyone looking to engage with the vibrant, evolving artistic pulse of Tribeca, the Lower East Side, Two Bridges, and Chinatown.

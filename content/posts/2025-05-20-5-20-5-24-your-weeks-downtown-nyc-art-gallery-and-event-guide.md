As this week’s downtown art circuit wraps, we close out with a spotlight on our featured artist, Delaney Conner—a rising New York City-based fiber artist whose work challenges perceptions of femininity, identity, and space through sharply geometric, large-scale embroidered portraits. Her pieces—on view now in the Lower East Side—reject the softness often projected onto both her medium and her subject matter, presenting instead a bold, abstraction-driven study of the female form as part of a greater collective experience. Don’t miss her opening reception and Artist Talk at 8:00 PM, where she’ll dive deeper into the architectural influences, emotional texture, and social commentary behind her work.

From SoHo fashion launches to book events in Tribeca, cutting-edge openings in Chinatown, and intimate gatherings in the West Village, this week’s 14thbelow.com Art Event Guide has been your curated compass to what’s vibrant and vital below 14th Street. And if you’re heading out Thursday, be sure to check out our interactive map to help you navigate the evening’s top exhibitions and events across all five neighborhoods with ease.

Thanks for following along. We’ll see you on the street—and in the gallery.
